# Linked List Implementation

Here, we are focusing on implementation of linked list and its functions in the files [linkedlist.h](linkedlist.h) and [linkedlist.c](linkedlist.c)

1) The file [linkedlist.h](linkedlist.h) contains the structure definations, function declarations and macros used for the Linked List implementation.

2) The file [linkedlist.c](linkedlist.c) contains the functions definations for the functions defined in [linkedlist.h](linkedlist.h) to be used for Linked List implementation.
